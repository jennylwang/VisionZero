Enforcement of Vision Zero Causes Upticks in Some Types of Traffic Tickets

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Vision Zero, a road safety initiative aimed at eliminating deaths and injuries by traffic accidents, in early 2014.  The plan’s signature move, reducing New York City’s speed limit from 30 MPH to 25 MPH, went into effect on November 7, 2014 

	Since then, multiple agencies have joined together to enforce the new traffic laws.  The Department of Transportation placed 3000 new speed limit signs around the city.   But majority of the work fell on to the shoulders of the New York Police Department.  A comparison of traffic summons issued this year and last indicates that police officers may be focusing more heavily on certain offenses in the light of the new laws.
	
	The NYPD divides the city into eight districts – Manhattan North, Manhattan South, Bronx, Queens North, Queens South, Brooklyn North, Brooklyn South and Staten Island.  Of the eight districts, six experienced lower rates of traffic summons issued.  Only Bronx and Manhattan South have more tickets issued in the February of this year compared to the same time last year.  
	
	Summonses are down overall throughout New York City.  The NYPD issued 86,018 summonses citywide in January of 2014.  During the same month this year, 64,476 summonses were issued, representing a 25 percent decrease.  
	
	However, the reasons drivers are ticketed may have shifted.  Looking at data from February of 2014 and 2015, seven out of eight districts issued more summons for “not giving the right of way to pedestrians” this year than last.  Additionally, five of the districts issued more tickets for “not giving the right of way to vehicles” in 2015.  
	
	Similarly, speeding looks to have garnered extra attention this year.  The number of speeding tickets has increased in every district except for Brooklyn North.  Another offense, “unsafe lane change,” has also gotten ticketed more in every district except for Queens South. 
	
	Yet some other driving violations seem to be overlooked.  In five of the districts, fewer tickets were issued for making improper turns.  A similar offense, improper passing, has garnered fewer tickets in half of the districts.
	
	In general, tickets regarding offenses not directly related to driving have declined.  Comparing January of this year and last, tickets for cell phone use went down from 8620 to 4713; tickets for not wearing a seatbelt decreased from 7344 to 4287. 
Enforcement regarding vehicle-related problems, such as defective brake lights or tinted windows, is also significant more lax. Summonses for having uninspected, uninsured or unregistered vehicles, or driving as an unlicensed operator, have dropped noticeably as well. 

	As part of the Vision Zero plan, the New York City government is also committed to improving certain dangerous streets and intersection.  The U.S. Department of Transportation has granted $25 million of federal money to be used towards 13 projects around the city, including schools, intersections and bike paths. 

TK: I will be speaking to the executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign (TSTC), Veronica Vanterpool.  TSTC has called for more funding for Vision Zero, so I will talk to her about what more can be done to improve Vision Zero, as well as the current enforcement issues.

TK: I’ve also gotten in touch with Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for bicycling, walking and public transit.  They’re arranging an interview for me with one of their media people. 

TK: NYPD told me to email a media request to their public information office.  Still waiting for their response.
