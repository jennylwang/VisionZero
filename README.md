In this scenario, the story will compare traffic summons by districts with the number of vehicle collisions.  The NYPD data divides the city into eight districts – Manhattan North, Manhattan South, Bronx, Queens North, Queens South, Brooklyn North, Brooklyn South and Staten Island.    

The data will be shown as an interactive map of New York; the map will be divided into the eight districts.  When the user mouses over each district, a pop up will appear.  The pop up will contain the number of vehicle collisions and number of traffic violations issued since Vision Zero went into effect (in November).  The map will only contain two colours – the boroughs with two districts will have blue and green (one colour for each district), while boroughs with a single district will just be green.

Middle

To take it one step further, the middle scenario will break the data down into precincts.  The map will be divided by precincts, and the popup will show the data from that precinct.  Precincts with obvious contrast – such as a high rate of collision combined with a low rate of summons issued – will be highlighted in red.  The rest of the precincts will be in blue.

There will be a mobile version of the map.  To make viewing easier on the smaller screen, the app will not have maps.  Instead, there will be a list of precincts, grouped together by their districts.  The user can click on the precinct name to see all of its data.  Additionally, interactive quotes (designed like the ones from Guardian’s heroin project) will be added to show different New Yorker’s experiences with traffic.
